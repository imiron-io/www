    <h3 class="name">Ichiro Hasuo</h2>
    <p class="position">CSO / Founder</p>
    <p>Prof. Ichiro Hasuo leads the theoretical foundations of our work as co-founder and Chief Scientific Officer. As Research Director of the JST ERATO MMSD (Metamathematics for Systems Design) Project at Japan's National Institute of Informatics (NII), his research bridges the gap between rigorous mathematical frameworks and practical system design.</p>
    <p>A Professor at NII and Director of the Mathematical Reliable Software Systems Research Center, Ichiro brings two decades of expertise in theoretical computer science, with particular depth in system verification and programming language theory. His work has earned international recognition, including Distinguished Paper Awards at leading conferences such as CAV and CONCUR, and the Science and Technology Prize from Japan's Ministry of Education.</p>
    <p>Prior to his current roles, Ichiro held positions at the University of Tokyo and Kyoto University. He completed his Ph.D. at Radboud University Nijmegen, establishing a truly international perspective that informs his pragmatic approach to theoretical challenges. This combination of deep theoretical understanding and practical application drives our company's innovative approach to system design and verification.</p>
