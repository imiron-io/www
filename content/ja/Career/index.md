<h4>採用について</h4>

At Imiron, we're on a mission to push the boundaries of technology in a critical domain. We're a young startup looking for exceptional individuals to join us. You'll be working with Dr. James Haydon and Prof. Ichiro Hasuo, with a chance to shape the early design of the product.

## Who We're Looking For

We're seeking talented individuals across a range of engineering disciplines. Some of our positions will require strong academic credentials (PhD+), whereas for others practical experience and a proven track record are more important than formal qualifications.

At the moment we are specifically hiring for two roles:
- Junior Haskell Software Engineer.
- Junior Frontend Sofware Engineer (Typescript/Svelte).

## Our Tech Stack and Approach

- Our backend systems primarily use Haskell and embrace functional programming principles.
- We strive for correctness and quality, balanced with the need for rapid prototyping and experimentation.

## Our Culture

- Relaxed work environment that values substance over formality.
- Focus on doing things right, without getting bogged down in unnecessary details.
- Collaborative atmosphere.

## Location

Our office is based in Tokyo, Japan, and we're primarily looking for candidates who can maintain a presence in Tokyo. We value face-to-face collaboration for key meetings and strategic discussions, but we also offer flexibility in day-to-day work arrangements. For exceptional talent, we may consider fully remote work arrangements.
